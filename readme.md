# Bangla Cyberbullying Text Classification

This repository contains research and implementation for cyberbullying text classification in the Bangla language.

## Overview

This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for detecting cyberbullying content in Bangla text data. The system is designed to identify harmful content across various cyberbullying categories.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12.4
- Dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bangla-cyberbullying.git
   cd bangla-cyberbullying
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   > **Note:** You can also create a virtual environment using the `uv` package manager to suit the Python version:
   > ```bash
   > uv venv venv python=3.12.4
   > ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
